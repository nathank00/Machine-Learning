# Machine-Learning

### File 1: ML_practice.ipynb
This File is my practice using various machine learning and linear modelling packages. Basically show how to conduct PCA on a high-dimensionality dataset and reduce the dimensions by amount of retained variance or by number of desired dimensions post-transformation. The data used in the machine learning is the visual digit images that show any number [0,9] and the program attempts to predict which target number is shown by a new image. ML model uses logistic regression from sklearn.

### File 2: PCA_fromscratch.py
This file is my attempt at creating a program that runs PCA on any dataset. The program does the PCA, then uses matplotlib to display the new cluster scheme of the transformed data relative to the most significant two principal components.
